# NFT Preview
A demonstration of previewing NFTs owned by a wallet in the browser, utilizing the Ankr SDK.

## Notes
To fix some CORS issues during local development, the Ankra SDK is being served from a local server. This is not necessary in production and could be removed to reduce Ankra API calls per user.
