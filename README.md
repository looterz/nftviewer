# NFT Preview
A demonstration of previewing NFTs owned by a wallet in the browser, utilizing the Ankr SDK.

You can view the demo here: https://nftviewer-nu.vercel.app/

## Notes
To fix some CORS issues, the Ankra SDK and external image content is being served from an API server. This introduces some latency on Vercel, but could be handled better in a production environment with a CDN, similar to how OpenSea handles their previews.
